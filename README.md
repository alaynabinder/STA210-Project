## Summary
This research project focuses on the critical issue of fleeing status in fatal police shootings in the United States. The primary research question investigates the relationship between various predictor variables and the likelihood of individuals fleeing during these encounters. By examining factors such as race, geographic location, and the presence of weapons, we aim to uncover the intricate dynamics that influence an individual's decision to flee in such situations. Our hypothesis anticipates that racial disparities and threat types may play significant roles in this complex equation.

## Data
This data is from the Washington Post Fatal Force Database. There are two datasets, one that containts information about the death record of the victims and another than includes information about the agency related to each incident. The data spans from 2015 to present day and is updated daily by researches at the Post. Every record must have at least two sources and be approved by an editor before being published.
